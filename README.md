# taskmat
taskmat is an open-source, text user interface application that runs directly in your Linux terminal. taskmat takes inspiration from vintage aircraft and automotive dashboards to display the state of your machine (much like Task Manager), providing a retro-styled, analog-gauge visual experience right in the command line.
